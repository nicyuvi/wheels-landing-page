View live project: https://wheelslandingpage.netlify.app/

### Features

- Mobile first design and responsive UI
- Local restaurant information
- Form validation / form handling
- Dynamic javascript components
- ES6 Modules

### What I learned

- Install dependencies with npm
- Bundle and minimize my code using Webpack.
- Preprocess my CSS using SASS and also create a maintainable file structure
- Create a dynamic javascript component
- Use Splide JS and US Resturant Menus API to create a local restaurant carousel
- Client side form validation
- Form handling using netlify and custom page redirects using javascript

### Problems I faced

- The trickiest part of this project was configuring Webpack for the first time.
